                <p >Even if we significantly curb emissions in the coming decades, more than
                    a third of the worldâ€™s remaining glaciers will melt before the year 2100. When
                   it comes to sea ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic is already
                   gone.

                    rise?</h3>
                <P>
                    Melting glaciers add to rising sea levels, which in turn increases coastal erosion and 
elevates storm surge as warming air and ocean temperatures create more frequent 
and intense coastal storms like hurricanes and typhoons. Specifically, the Greenland 
and Antarctic ice sheets are the largest contributors of global sea level rise. Right 
now, the Greenland ice sheet is disappearing four times faster than in 2003 and 
already contributes 20% of current sea level rise.
How much and how quickly these Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets melt in the 
future will largely determine how much ocean levels rise in the future. If emissions 
continue to rise, the current rate of melting on the Greenland ice sheet is expected 
to double by the end of the century. Alarmingly, if all the ice on Greenland melted, it 
would raise global sea levels by 20 feet

                    patterns?
                    </h3>
                <P>
                    Today, the Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere on earth, and 
the sea ice there is declining by more than 10% every 10 years. As this ice melts, 
darker patches of ocean start to emerge, eliminating the effect that previously 
cooled the poles, creating warmer air temperatures and in turn disrupting normal 
patterns of ocean circulation. Research shows the polar vortex is appearing outside 
of the Arctic more frequently because of changes to the jet stream, caused by a 
combination of warming air and ocean temperatures in the Arctic and the tropics.
The glacial melt we are witnessing today in Antarctic and Greenland is changing the
circulation of the Atlantic Ocean and has been linked to collapse of fisheries in the 
Gulf of Maine and more destructive storms and hurricanes around the planet.

                    SOLUTIONS TO AVOID MELTING GLACIERS
                </h3>
                <P>
                    Glaciologists believe that, despite the massive ice loss, we do still have time 
                    to save the glaciers from their predicted disappearance. Here are some ideas
                    and proposals for how we can help achieve this goal:

                    Stop climate change

                    <P>
                        In order to curtail climate change and save the glaciers, it is indispensable 
                        that global CO2 emissions be reduced by 45 % over the next decade, and that 
                        they fall to zero after 2050.

                        <P>
                            The scientific journal Nature suggested building a 100-metre-long dam in front 
                            of the Jakobshavn glacier (Greenland), the worst affected by Arctic melting, to 
                            contain its erosion.

                           </h3>
                            <P>
Indonesian architect Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha won an award for his 
project Refreeze the Arctic, which consists of collecting water from melted 
glaciers, desalinating it and refreezing it to create large hexagonal ice blocks. 
Thanks to their shape, these icebergs could then be combined to create frozen 
masses.

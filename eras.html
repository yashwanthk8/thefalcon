                <p >The Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic Eras
                    The Geologic Time Scale is the history of the Earth broken down into four spans of time marked by various events, such as the emergence of certain species, their evolution, and their extinction, that help distinguish one era from another. Strictly speaking, Precambrian Time is not an actual era due to the lack of diversity of life, however, it's still considered significant because it predates the other three eras and may hold clues as to how all life on Earth eventually came to be.

                <P>
                    Precambrian Time: 4.6 billion to 542 Million Years Ago 
                    Precambrian Time started at the beginning of the Earth 4.6 billion years ago. For billions of years, there was no life on the planet. It wasn't until the end of Precambrian Time that single-celled organisms came into existence. No one is certain how life on Earth began, but theories include

                <P>
                    In addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. Healthy forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as valuable carbon sinks. Deforested areas lose that ability and release more carbon.

                1. Government Regulations</h3>
                <P>
The best solution to deforestation is to curb the felling 
of trees by enforcing a series of rules and laws to 
govern it. Deforestation in the current scenario may 
have reduced; however, it would be too early to assume.
The money-churner nature of forest resources can be 
tempting enough for deforestation to continue.

                    2. Banning Clear-Cutting of Forests</h3>
                    <P>
                        this will curb the total depletion of the forest cover. It is a
                        practical solution and is very feasible.

                       </h3>
                        <P>
Land skinned of its tree cover for urban settlements 
should be urged to plant trees in the vicinity and replace 
the cut trees. Also, the cutting must be replaced 
by planting young trees to replace the older ones that 
were cut.
Trees are being planted under several initiatives every 
year, but they still don’t match the numbers of the ones 
we’ve already lost

                            4. Reduce Consumption of Paper
                           </h3>
                            <P>
                                Your daily consumption of paper includes printing paper, 
                                notebooks, napkins, toilet paper, etc. Try to reduce 
                                consumption, reduce waste of paper and also opt for 
                                recycled paper products.
                                Make life simple such as printing/writing on both sides of 
                                the paper, using less toilet paper, avoiding paper plates, 
                                and napkins and wherever possible, go paperless.

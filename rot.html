            <p>The axis has an angle of23(1/2) degree. And is perpendicular to the plane of Earth’s orbit. This means the Earth is tilted on its axis, and because of this tilt, the northern and southern hemispheres lean in a direction away from the Sun. The rotation of the Earth divides it into a lit-up half and a dark half, which gives rise to day and night. The direction of the Earth’s rotation depends on the direction of viewing. When viewed looking down from the North Pole, Earth spins counter clockwise. On the contrary, when viewed looking down from the south pole, the earth spins in the clockwise direction.
                Earth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the Sun, but once every 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to other distant stars (see below). Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past.

                <h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl text-gray-900 font-medium title-font mb-2">REVOLUTION OF EARTH</h1>
                <p>
                    The movement of the earth around the sun is known as “revolution”, the earth revolves around the sun along with the rotations.
Earth revolves in orbit around the sun in 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes with reference to the stars, at a speed ranging from 29.29 to 30.29 km/s. The 6 hours, 9 minutes adds up to about an extra day every fourth year, which is designated a leap year, with the extra day added as February 29th.

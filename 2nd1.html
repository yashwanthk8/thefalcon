                <p >Deforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural, or accidental means. It can occur in any area densely populated by trees and other plant life, but the majority of it is currently happening in the Amazon rainforest.

                <h3 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">LOSS OF HABITAT</h3>
                <P>
                    One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due to their loss of habitat. 70% of land animals and plant species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known to us, but also those unknown.
The trees of the rainforest that provide shelter for some species also provide the canopy that regulates the temperature. Deforestation results in a more drastic temperature variation from day to night, much like a desert, which could prove fatal for many inhabitants.

                </P>
                <h3 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">INCREASED GREENHOUSE GASES</h3>
                <P>
                    In addition to the loss of habitat, the lack of trees also allows a greater amount of greenhouse gases to be released into the atmosphere. Healthy forests absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, acting as valuable carbon sinks. Deforested areas lose that ability and release more carbon.

                </P>

                <h3 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">
                1. Government Regulations</h3>
                <P>
The best solution to deforestation is to curb the felling 
of trees by enforcing a series of rules and laws to 
govern it. Deforestation in the current scenario may 
have reduced; however, it would be too early to assume.
The money-churner nature of forest resources can be 
tempting enough for deforestation to continue.

                    2. Banning Clear-Cutting of Forests</h3>
                    <P>
                        this will curb the total depletion of the forest cover. It is a
                        practical solution and is very feasible.

                        3. Reforestation and Afforestation
                       </h3>
                        <P>
Land skinned of its tree cover for urban settlements 
should be urged to plant trees in the vicinity and replace 
the cut trees. Also, the cutting must be replaced 
by planting young trees to replace the older ones that 
were cut.
Trees are being planted under several initiatives every 
year, but they still don’t match the numbers of the ones 
we’ve already lost

                            4. Reduce Consumption of Paper
                           </h3>
                            <P>
                                Your daily consumption of paper includes printing paper, 
                                notebooks, napkins, toilet paper, etc. Try to reduce 
                                consumption, reduce waste of paper and also opt for 
                                recycled paper products.
                                Make life simple such as printing/writing on both sides of 
                                the paper, using less toilet paper, avoiding paper plates, 
                                and napkins and wherever possible, go paperless.

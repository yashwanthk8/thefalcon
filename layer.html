        <p>
            The earth is made up of four layers, they are:
1. Crust, 2. Mantle, 3. Outer Core, 4. Inner Core.
Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to 
shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, 
no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever 
drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles).
Scientists know about the layers of the earth by sending seismic sound waves through 
the earth. Because layers of different densities (see earlier question) will allow sound 
waves to travel through them differently, we can study the sound waves to understand the 
layers of the earth.

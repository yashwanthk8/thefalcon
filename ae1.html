                <p >There are many names for our earth in different languages, in Sanskrit it is called as "PRITHVI", in Telugu it is known as "Bhumi".But the actual word earth is originated from the 'Anglo-Saxon'(English-German) language where the word 'ERDA' and it is "GERMANIC" equivalent is 'ERDE' means ground/soil. In Old English, the word 'Earth' became 'EOR'.

                <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">LAYER'S OF EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE</h1>
                <p >We have four major domains, they are:<br>1.Lithosphere<br>2.stratosphere<br>3.Mesosphere<br>4.Thermosphere<br>5.Exosphere
                </p>
                <h4 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">1.Lithosphere</h4>
                <p >The lithosphere is the solid, outer part of Earth. The lithosphere includes the brittle upper portion of the mantle and the crust, the outermost layers of Earth's structure. It is bounded by the atmosphere above and the asthenosphere (another part of the upper mantle)
                </p>  
                <h4 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">2.stratosphere</h4>
                <p >
                    The stratosphere is the second layer of our atmosphere, above the troposphere. The bottom of the stratosphere moves up and down, the way a wave on the ocean rolls, depending on where on Earth you are and what season it is. It can be as low as about 5 miles off the ground and reaches up to about 31 miles high.
                </p> 
                <h4 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">3.Mesosphere</h4>
                <p >
                    The mesosphere is the third and coldest layer of Earth's atmosphere, reaching about 130 degrees below zero. The mesosphere is also where most meteors, or space rocks and metal, burn up before they can crash to the ground. It's like a superhero's force field that protects the Earth!
                </p> 
                <h4 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">4.Thermosphere</h4>
                <p >
                    The thermosphere lies between the exosphere and the mesosphere. “Thermo” means heat, and the temperature in this layer can reach up to 4,500 degrees Fahrenheit. If you were to hang out in the thermosphere, though, you would be very cold because there aren't enough gas molecules to transfer the heat to you.
                </p>
                <h4 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">5.Exosphere</h4>
                <p >
                    The exosphere is the outermost layer of our atmosphere. “Exo” means outside and is the same prefix used to describe insects like grasshoppers that have a hard shell or “exoskeleton” on the outside of their body. The exosphere is the very edge of our atmosphere.
